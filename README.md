# WP-Gro
This project is to help WordPress webmaster If you want to remove specific "fields" and "projects" or customized WordPress administrator background elements can be referenced.

At the moment we're just suggesting a reference direction and no plug-ins to assist, so you're responsible for these changes.

## Update time

Time is not necessarily! And I'll also be labeled based on which version or new version will be modified, and if WordPress doesn't make significant changes, at least the files that have been removed can be directly overwritten.

###How to use

```bash
Please override directly depending on which directory the modified archive is located in
```
